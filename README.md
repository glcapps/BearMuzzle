A lightweight CPU-side model that dynamically adjusts the logits of a larger LLM during inference ‚Äî for real-time steering, behavioral shaping, or stylistic control without modifying the base model.

### üß© Concepts Used

BearMuzzle modulates the behavior of a large language model (LLM) by manipulating the **logits** ‚Äî the raw scores the LLM assigns to each possible next token before sampling.

#### What Is a Logit?

A *logit* is a raw, unnormalized score representing the model‚Äôs preference for a specific token. At each step of generation:

- The model computes a logit for every token in its vocabulary.
- These logits are passed through a softmax function to become probabilities.
- The higher the logit, the more likely that token will be selected.

#### What Is a Logit Penalty?

BearMuzzle applies a **logit penalty vector** to steer the model:

- This vector has one value per token in the vocabulary.
- Each value is a non-negative number subtracted from the corresponding token's logit.
- The higher the penalty, the more that token is discouraged ‚Äî but not forbidden.

This technique allows nuanced control:
- A penalty of `0.0` leaves the token untouched.
- A penalty of `0.2` subtly reduces the token‚Äôs chance.
- A penalty of `5.0` heavily discourages the token.
- Unlike hard masks, the token is still available, allowing for more fluent and flexible generation.

This **logit attenuation** approach enables BearMuzzle to shape style, tone, and behavior dynamically without modifying the base model or prompt.

### üß† Core Concepts and Mechanics

This section explains key mechanisms used in BearMuzzle for readers unfamiliar with logit manipulation and lightweight companion models.

---

#### 1. Logit Penalty and Attenuation vs Masking

- A *logit* is the raw score before softmax.
- BearMuzzle subtracts a penalty from selected logits to reduce their sampling probability.
- Unlike hard masks (which set logits to `-inf`), attenuation keeps the token available ‚Äî just less likely.
- Think of it like dimming a light rather than switching it off.

---

#### 2. Penalty Vector Composition

BearMuzzle may combine multiple penalty vectors (e.g., tone, safety, domain) using:

- **Summation**: Adds each vector element-wise.
- **Max Aggregation**: Uses the strongest penalty per token.
- **Weighted Fusion**: Scales and sums different behaviors.

Example:

Tone Penalty: `[0.1, 0.0, 0.3]`  
Safety Penalty: `[0.0, 0.5, 0.1]`

- Summation: `[0.1, 0.5, 0.4]`
- Max: `[0.1, 0.5, 0.3]`

---

#### 3. Delta Logit Dataset Construction

To train a sidekick model:

- Run LLM twice: once with a behavioral prefix, once without.
- Record the logits for the same prompt/output.
- Compute the *difference* (delta) between the two outputs per token.

Example:

- Logits without prefix: `[1.5, 0.3]`
- Logits with prefix: `[1.0, 0.8]`
- Delta: `[-0.5, +0.5]`

This teaches BearMuzzle how the prefix modifies output behavior.

---

#### 4. Forced Token Emission / Injection

BearMuzzle can inject tokens (e.g., "In summary,") before resuming standard generation by:

- Setting the desired token‚Äôs logit high (or others to `-inf`) at that step.
- Softmax ensures the forced token is selected.

This maintains continuity in the sampling loop, without re-encoding the full context.

---

#### 5. Streaming and Time-to-First-Token

Why BearMuzzle avoids latency:

- Prefixing a prompt adds re-tokenization and warmup costs.
- BearMuzzle steers behavior *post-context*, avoiding changes to the original prompt.
- It computes penalties incrementally as tokens are generated.

---

#### 6. Ternary Weights vs Ternary Activations

- **Ternary Weights**: Model parameters use values from {-1, 0, +1}, allowing extreme compression (~1.58 bits).
- **Ternary Activations**: Intermediate neuron outputs also restricted to ternary values.
- BearMuzzle mostly assumes ternary weights, which are easier to optimize and compress.

---

#### 7. Context Matching and Tokenizer Fidelity

BearMuzzle and the main LLM must use the *exact same tokenizer*.

- If token IDs mismatch, the penalty will apply to the wrong token.
- Example: If "hello" is one token in the main model, but two ("he", "llo") in BearMuzzle, the steering breaks.

---

#### 8. Sparse vs Dense Penalty Vectors

- **Sparse**: Only a few token IDs receive non-zero penalties.
- **Dense**: All tokens are adjusted.

Sparse vectors are faster and consume less memory ‚Äî ideal for real-time applications.

---

#### 9. Gradient Accumulation (for Low-Memory Training)

When batch size is too small for good gradients:

- Accumulate gradients over multiple mini-batches.
- Perform one optimizer step every N batches.

This simulates large batches on devices with limited RAM (e.g., 16GB Mac Mini).

---

#### 10. Logit Bias vs Logit Attenuation

OpenAI‚Äôs `logit_bias` applies static, fixed adjustments.

- BearMuzzle is dynamic ‚Äî it computes penalties based on full context and output prefix at every generation step.
- More adaptive, fluent, and task-specific.

üß† BearMuzzle: A Companion Model for Real-Time LLM Guidance

BearMuzzle's CPU-optimized design ensures low-latency feedback by running inference alongside GPU token generation, leveraging asynchronous computation rather than serial prompt rewriting.

üßÆ Why Attenuation Matters

Traditional logit masks often operate in binary: a token is either allowed (0) or completely suppressed (-inf). This rigid control can break fluency, produce unnatural phrasing, or entirely eliminate valuable tokens due to overaggressive filtering.

BearMuzzle, in contrast, uses a real-valued attenuation system:

- Penalties are floating-point scalars (e.g. 0.1‚Äì6.0) applied subtractively to logits.
- A mild penalty subtly discourages a token without forbidding it.
- Multiple influences (e.g. tone, safety, domain) can layer penalties in a nuanced fashion.
- This preserves fluency and diversity while applying directional guidance.

This technique avoids degenerate behavior common in hard-masking systems and improves compatibility with autoregressive sampling. It enables BearMuzzle to act as a bias shaper rather than a censor.

üìå Summary

This proposal outlines a system in which a secondary, ultra-lightweight language model runs concurrently with a larger LLM to adjust its logit mask in real-time. This enables dynamic, context-aware control over token selection during inference‚Äîusing minimal CPU resources‚Äîwithout modifying the main model‚Äôs architecture or requiring retraining.

üéØ Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Real-time control over the token generation process of a large LLM
	‚Ä¢	Modulate token probabilities via logit attenuation (not hard masking)
	‚Ä¢	Offload this logic to a smaller CPU-based model for efficiency
	‚Ä¢	Enable steering, censorship, domain shaping, or stylistic adjustment without retraining

‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

Components
	‚Ä¢	Primary LLM (GPU-based): A standard transformer generating tokens, one step at a time.
	‚Ä¢	Secondary LLM (CPU-based): A fast, quantized model (~1.5-bit ternary model) that:
	‚Ä¢	Receives the same input context
	‚Ä¢	Optionally receives current output prefix
	‚Ä¢	Outputs a logit attenuation vector per token step

Workflow
	1.	The primary LLM begins a token-by-token inference loop.
	2.	At each step:
	‚Ä¢	The current context and prefix are sent to the CPU-based secondary LLM.
	‚Ä¢	The secondary LLM emits a logit attenuation vector (a sparse or dense penalty map).
	‚Ä¢	The logit penalties are subtracted from the primary LLM‚Äôs raw logits.
	‚Ä¢	Sampling or decoding proceeds as usual.

üéöÔ∏è Logit Attenuation vs Masking

Rather than using a binary hard mask, this system uses attenuation ‚Äî real-valued penalties that adjust token probability without forbidding output.

Key Properties
	‚Ä¢	Penalty values are non-negative and subtracted from logits.
	‚Ä¢	Zero means ‚Äúno change‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Allows for nuanced guidance and avoids degeneracy

Example Penalty Table

Token	Penalty	Meaning
<profanity>	4.5	Strong discouragement
like	0.2	Mild stylistic softening
enterprise	0.0	No penalty
lol	1.0	Moderate informality penalty

Pseudocode

logits = big_model.forward(context)
penalties = small_model.forward(context, output_so_far)
logits -= penalties  # Apply attenuation before softmax
next_token = sample(logits)

This approach blends the flexibility of logit bias with the token-aware granularity of real-time soft control. Unlike static logit_bias settings in APIs or binary masks that entirely exclude tokens, attenuation enables expressive preference shaping ‚Äî for example, discouraging profanity or informal slang without eliminating the possibility of nuanced use. This makes BearMuzzle suitable for domains where tone and subtlety matter.

üß© Token Injection for Soft Steering


BearMuzzle can optionally inject a predetermined sequence of tokens‚Äîsuch as a reminder, directive, or soft prompt‚Äîat the start of inference. This sequence is injected directly into the output stream ‚Äî bypassing sampling ‚Äî to ensure exact reproduction of the prescribed phrasing. During this phase, token generation is forced rather than sampled, enabling precise behavioral seeding before resuming normal inference.

Key advantages:
- The injection occurs at the token level, avoiding prompt engineering or modified context.
- It does not delay the time-to-first-token (unlike prepending to the prompt).
- The position of the injected sequence can be tracked, and the tokens can be removed from the final output if desired, maintaining clean user-facing responses.
- Because it does not alter the model's prompt or context window, it avoids latency penalties associated with prepending behavior instructions ‚Äî making it well-suited for streaming inference and low-latency applications.

üìè Boundary Tracking and Output Cleanup

Each injected sequence is accompanied by metadata recording its exact position in the generated output. This allows downstream components to:
- Identify injected spans unambiguously
- Optionally remove them from the final user-facing string
- Preserve alignment for downstream processing or auditing
- Enable token-aligned removal of injected sequences during post-processing, ensuring clean and faithful user-facing output while retaining full traceability for audit logs or interaction replay.

These positions are typically tracked using token start and end indices within the output stream. Since the tokens are deterministically emitted, this tracking is robust even in streaming contexts or multistep pipelines.

üîÅ Midstream Injection

While the primary use case for injection is at the beginning of inference, BearMuzzle can also inject token sequences mid-generation. This allows for dynamic rerouting of behavior during long responses ‚Äî for example, to restate safety instructions or pivot to a different tone.

Midstream injection follows the same forced-token mechanism, temporarily overriding the sampler to emit an exact sequence. After injection, BearMuzzle resumes attenuation-based steering seamlessly. These mid-output injections are useful in agentic workflows, interactive storytelling, or multi-turn dialogue control, where behavior may need reinforcement without modifying the initial prompt.

üîí Implementation Detail:
The injected tokens are hard-coded into the output sequence by setting their corresponding logits to negative infinity for all non-target tokens during each forced step. This ensures deterministic emission of the intended phrase while preserving the integrity of the model's internal token state.


üîÑ Post-Injection Attenuation

Once the forced injection sequence is completed, BearMuzzle transitions seamlessly into its standard operation mode: generating per-token logit penalties for the remainder of the inference loop. This allows the injected phrase to serve as a deterministic behavioral cue, after which the system continues to apply real-time, context-sensitive steering using logit attenuation. This transition is automatic and does not require external intervention or structural changes to the prompt or inference loop.

This allows BearMuzzle to softly shape the main model's behavior with high specificity and minimal infrastructure changes.

üïí Latency Consideration

Unlike prompt engineering approaches that prepend instructions into the model‚Äôs context‚Äîthus increasing input length and computation‚ÄîBearMuzzle‚Äôs injection strategy introduces no additional context-related latency. Because the injected tokens are emitted at the output stage (rather than parsed as part of the input), they preserve fast time-to-first-token performance. This makes BearMuzzle compatible with real-time chat interfaces, streaming decoders, and applications sensitive to generation delay.

üîç Comparison with Prompt Engineering and Related Techniques

BearMuzzle's injection mechanism offers a distinct alternative to conventional prompt engineering:

- Unlike system prompts or prepended instructions, it does not consume context tokens.
- Unlike learned soft prompts or embeddings, it does not require retraining or context modification.
- Unlike OpenAI's `logit_bias`, it operates at each token step in real time and supports dynamic, per-token behavior.

This allows BearMuzzle to combine the flexibility of prompt-based steering with the precision of token-level control ‚Äî without incurring the cost or complexity of modifying prompts, learning embeddings, or rebuilding token sequences. It is especially useful in latency-sensitive applications, multi-agent settings, or interactive use cases where dynamic control must be applied post-prompt.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges

Latency
	‚Ä¢	The small model must run in <5ms to avoid bottlenecks.
	‚Ä¢	Pre-generation or speculative lookahead may be needed.

Context Synchronization
	‚Ä¢	The BearMuzzle must consume the full token context, identical to the input fed to the main LLM.
	‚Ä¢	This guarantees behavioral fidelity, especially for prefix-simulation use cases.
	‚Ä¢	Tokenization must be consistent between both models.

Vocabulary Size
	‚Ä¢	Full vocab (e.g. 50k tokens) may be too large for direct output.
	‚Ä¢	Prefer sparse updates or top-k token attenuation.

Merging Multiple Influences
	‚Ä¢	Penalties from different sources (style, safety, persona) must be composable.
	‚Ä¢	Strategy: sum or max of penalties per token.

üè† Model Details

What is a 1.5-bit LLM?

A 1.5-bit LLM uses ternary weight representation: -1, 0, and 1, which equates to 1.58 bits per parameter.

Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Extremely compact memory footprint
	‚Ä¢	Efficient matrix ops using integer math
	‚Ä¢	Runs on general-purpose CPUs

Architectural Options:
	‚Ä¢	Tiny transformer with ternary quantization
	‚Ä¢	Shallow RNN or GRU with binary weights
	‚Ä¢	Token-attention MLP trained for penalty regression

‚ö° Why 1.5-bit Models Are CPU-Friendly

The use of ternary weights (values -1, 0, or +1) is not only memory-efficient ‚Äî it also leads to significantly faster inference on general-purpose CPUs. Here's why:

- **Multiplication-Free Math**: Instead of floating-point operations, matrix multiplications become additions, subtractions, or skips (for zeroes). This reduces instruction overhead and energy consumption.
- **Cache and Bandwidth Efficiency**: With fewer bits per parameter (1.58 bits vs. 8+), more weights fit into CPU caches, reducing memory bottlenecks ‚Äî a major factor for CPU-bound inference.
- **Simplified Kernels**: Inference kernels can use integer math and even bitwise operations to pack and process ternary matrices efficiently. This aligns well with SIMD instruction sets (AVX, NEON).
- **On-the-Fly Decoding**: Packed ternary representations compress well, enabling fast loading and decoding at runtime ‚Äî helpful for on-device or edge deployment.

These benefits make ternary LLMs a practical match for sidecar models like BearMuzzle, where real-time performance must be achieved using CPU resources alone.

üì¶ Memory Advantages of 1.5-bit Models

Ternary quantization (1.58 bits per parameter) yields substantial memory-related benefits, making it ideal for low-resource and edge inference:

- **Drastically Smaller Model Size**: A 100M parameter model fits in ~20MB, compared to ~400MB for float32. This makes on-device or embedded deployment practical.
- **Better Cache Utilization**: More parameters fit into CPU L1/L2 cache lines, reducing memory latency and boosting throughput ‚Äî especially important on CPUs without specialized matrix hardware.
- **Efficient Bandwidth Usage**: Lower memory footprint translates to fewer memory fetches, improving inference speed on memory-bound systems.
- **Multi-Model Hosting**: With compact representations, several behavior-specific models can coexist in RAM, enabling fast runtime switching or ensemble shaping.
- **Streamable and Compressed**: Models can be stored in compressed formats with near-zero overhead, aiding container-based or mobile deployment scenarios.
- **Embedded-Agnostic**: While embedded environments benefit greatly from the reduced footprint, BearMuzzle is explicitly designed for general-purpose CPUs. This avoids hardware-specific constraints while still achieving near-embedded efficiency.

These memory savings compound the compute efficiency gains to make 1.5-bit ternary models an ideal sidekick for real-time logit modulation on CPU-bound systems.

üîç Precision Notes on Intermediary Layers

While BearMuzzle uses 1.58-bit ternary quantization for model weights, the bit depth of intermediary computations ‚Äî such as activations, attention scores, and normalization outputs ‚Äî can vary and may influence both runtime speed and precision.

‚úÖ Current Practice:
- **Weights**: Stored as ternary values (-1, 0, +1), using ~1.58 bits per parameter.
- **Activations**: Typically computed in int8, int4, or float16.
- **Attention and Norm Ops**: May require float16 or float32 temporarily due to softmax or residual scaling operations.

This hybrid-precision approach balances efficiency and model fidelity:
- Low bit-width activations reduce RAM usage and improve matrix op speed.
- Mixed precision preserves expressive power where needed.

üß™ Potential Optimizations:
- Explore ternary activations or integer-only attention for even leaner inference loops.
- Support selectable quantization tiers (e.g., "low-latency", "balanced", "high-precision") to match application constraints.

üß† Why It Matters:
Even when weights are compact, intermediary values dominate the working memory during inference. Lowering activation precision helps maintain speed and memory efficiency, particularly for real-time inference on CPU.
Memory Considerations

Memory usage is not strictly limited to <100MB, but minimal memory footprint is a target for wide deployment. A tiered design allows for:

RAM Budget	Possible Architecture	Tradeoffs
<32MB	Tiny MLP, 1‚Äì2 layers	Extremely fast, very shallow
~64MB	2‚Äì4 layer ternary transformer	Good balance
128‚Äì256MB	6+ layers, wider heads	Higher latency, better semantics
>256MB	Near full LLM-lite	CPU may bottleneck

üí∞ Training Cost Considerations

Given that the BearMuzzle must process the full input context, training data must simulate full-context behavior accurately. This affects training cost as follows:

Training Dataset Construction
	‚Ä¢	For each training sample:
	‚Ä¢	Run the main LLM twice on a prompt:
	‚Ä¢	Once with a behavioral prefix (e.g., ‚ÄúAnswer formally.‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Once without
	‚Ä¢	Extract per-token logits and compute the delta between the two runs
	
	This delta captures the directional influence of the behavioral prefix on the main LLM's output distribution. BearMuzzle learns to reproduce this delta in real time as a logit attenuation vector, allowing it to steer the main model as though the prefix were present ‚Äî without modifying the prompt or context. Over many examples, the model generalizes from specific prefix behaviors to broader stylistic or safety tendencies.
	‚Ä¢	With full context (~4K tokens), this means that for each output token, BearMuzzle must learn from a token-wise delta over the entire input context
	‚Ä¢	If 10K prompts are used √ó 10 behaviors √ó 50 token generations = ~5 million labeled deltas
	‚Ä¢	These runs can be parallelized, but compute-intensive

Cost Impact (GPU-backed cloud or local training):

Phase	Resource	Cost (est.)
Data generation	700 GPU hours (A100)	~$350‚Äì$800
Dataset storage	~5GB	Negligible
BearMuzzle training	<10 GPU hours	~$10‚Äì$30 (or 3‚Äì14 days on M4-class device)

üìù Summary:
	‚Ä¢	Training the BearMuzzle is relatively light
	‚Ä¢	Generating its training data using full-context inference is the more expensive phase
	‚Ä¢	Training is feasible on consumer-grade GPUs or Mac-class CPUs, though training time may span multiple days
	‚Ä¢	Training is feasible on consumer-grade GPUs, even when using 4K token contexts

‚û°Ô∏è In future iterations, we may explore compressing or summarizing the context to reduce cost, but fidelity-first training requires matching the main model‚Äôs full prompt.


‚úÖ Conclusion on Context Matching
	‚Ä¢	The BearMuzzle‚Äôs fidelity depends on matching the token-level behavior of the target LLM
	‚Ä¢	Therefore, it must consume the full context window, with consistent tokenization
	‚Ä¢	This enables accurate simulation of behaviors encoded in long-range prompts or prefixes
	‚Ä¢	We note the associated increase in training and inference costs, and accept them as tradeoffs for behavior-preserving alignment

### ü™∂ Small Models, Large Influence: Efficient Training for Practical Sidekicks

BearMuzzle leverages extremely compact models ‚Äî often 1.5-bit ternary architectures with low parameter counts ‚Äî to act as real-time logit modulators. These models are not mere prototypes; they are highly practical for production use due to their size, speed, and generalization efficiency.

**Key advantages:**

- **Maximized Training Throughput**: Tiny models allow for massive-scale training on diverse behavioral deltas within a fixed compute budget. More examples can be processed per GPU hour, yielding broader generalization from richer signal.
- **Low Latency at Inference**: These models are designed for sub-5ms inference on commodity CPUs, allowing real-time use in agent loops or chat interfaces.
- **Behavioral Modularity**: Multiple compact models (e.g., tone, domain, safety) can coexist in RAM and contribute independently to the final penalty vector ‚Äî enabling dynamic fusion.
- **Transferability Across Models**: When token vocabularies align, the same compact sidekick model can steer multiple LLM variants ‚Äî maximizing ROI on training effort.
- **Edge Deployment**: Small models are viable for edge scenarios without dedicated GPU access, expanding the reach of adaptive inference systems.

Training these models on rich, high-coverage datasets ‚Äî generated by behavioral deltas from large LLMs ‚Äî yields a data-to-weight ratio that promotes robust generalization. The compactness does not limit usefulness; in fact, it enhances practicality.

This strategy contrasts with traditional large-model pretraining and opens a new path for behavior shaping: **train small models on rich token-wise behavioral guidance** and apply them widely across LLMs that share a vocabulary.

üöÄ Next Goals Toward Publication

To elevate this project to a level suitable for arXiv or conference submission, the following milestones must be reached:

These goals constitute the critical path from experimental design to public dissemination.

üîß llama.cpp makes it particularly straightforward to intercept token-level logits due to its transparent sampling loop and exposed API surface. This allows for rapid prototyping of BearMuzzle behaviors with minimal risk to core model stability.

üß† Use Cases Beyond Censorship

BearMuzzle is not limited to filtering or content suppression. Its ability to softly influence token selection opens up a diverse range of applications:

- üó£Ô∏è Tone Steering: Maintain formality, enthusiasm, or politeness without brittle prompt phrasing.
- üßæ Domain Alignment: Encourage legal, technical, or medical phrasing based on task context.
- üë§ Persona Shaping: Enforce consistent speaking style for virtual characters or brand voices.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Enforcement: Reduce likelihood of inappropriate or off-topic content generation.
- üîÅ Prompt Reweighting: Emphasize parts of the prompt (e.g., style guide, examples) dynamically during generation.
- ü™û Behavior Simulation: Inject temporary traits like sarcasm, humor, or formality for adaptive output control.
- üß≠ Dynamic Rerouting: Intervene mid-output to reinforce or shift conversational direction without restarting the model or altering initial prompts ‚Äî ideal for interactive agents or multi-turn reasoning tasks.

- üß† Chain-of-Thought Refinement: Insert hints or scaffolding mid-sequence to encourage multi-step reasoning or problem-solving, especially useful in educational tools or planning agents where guidance should adapt over time.

üß© Multi-Behavior Composition Strategies

BearMuzzle enables composable behavioral shaping by allowing multiple influence sources to contribute to the final logit penalty vector at each token step.

Strategies for combining multiple behaviors include:
- **Summation**: Additive combination of penalty vectors (e.g., tone + domain + safety).
- **Max Aggregation**: Use the highest penalty per token from all sources.
- **Weighted Fusion**: Learn a blending function to combine multiple influences dynamically.

Example:
- Tone guidance suggests discouraging slang.
- Safety model adds penalties for offensive terms.
- Domain alignment favors formal vocabulary.

These can be composed to produce a blended penalty vector that captures multiple overlapping constraints. This supports more nuanced and situation-aware generation without requiring explicit prompt changes or task switching.

BearMuzzle's compositional capability is particularly powerful in dynamic environments where task boundaries blur ‚Äî such as multi-agent systems, open-ended assistants, or adaptive storytelling ‚Äî allowing real-time interpolation between behavioral modes without hard transitions or re-prompts.
This flexibility enables dynamic context interpretation, such as progressively increasing the influence of a safety layer as the conversation veers into sensitive topics, or dialed modulation of tone as user mood shifts ‚Äî all without restarting the inference loop.
Another direction involves reactive shaping ‚Äî where BearMuzzle monitors generated output in real time and adjusts its attenuation strategy based on token-level trends or user feedback. For instance, if the generated text starts drifting off-topic, BearMuzzle could increase penalties for tangential branches or re-weight the original task signal. This creates a feedback loop that helps maintain alignment in evolving or ambiguous prompts.

#### 12. üß¨ Simulated Persona Merging

BearMuzzle enables multiple behavior-altering penalty vectors to be blended in real time, enabling composite personas.

Example scenario:

- **Tone Penalty Vector**: discourages aggressive or curt phrasing.
- **Safety Penalty Vector**: suppresses risky or inappropriate tokens.
- **Domain Penalty Vector**: promotes technical or field-specific vocabulary.

These vectors are combined using a weighted strategy:

```python
final_penalty = 0.5 * tone + 0.3 * safety + 0.2 * domain
```

This allows rich behavior synthesis. For example:

> ‚ÄúRespond like a helpful attorney with medical caution and polite tone.‚Äù

By adjusting weights dynamically, BearMuzzle can support fluid shifts in style and alignment without interrupting inference.

---

### üîÅ Model Transfer and Tokenizer Compatibility

BearMuzzle's logit attenuation vectors are tied to the output vocabulary of the main language model. These vectors operate over a specific token index mapping, meaning the compatibility of BearMuzzle with other models depends on whether they use the same tokenization scheme and output token IDs.

In the context of open-source models compatible with local inference (e.g., those run via `llama.cpp`), transferability of a trained BearMuzzle model is straightforward when:

- The large model uses the **same tokenizer** and **vocabulary index order**.
- The token IDs for commonly used tokens remain identical across models.

‚úÖ **Directly Compatible Examples**:
- LLaMA 2 7B and LLaMA 2 13B
- LLaMA 3 variants that preserve the tokenizer spec
- Mistral and Mixtral models when tokenizer reuse is confirmed

‚ùå **Incompatible Without Retraining**:
- LLaMA to Falcon (different tokenizer specs)
- Mistral to T5 or BLOOM variants
- Any cross-family transfer where tokenizer internals differ

If token IDs differ, then BearMuzzle's output will misalign ‚Äî applying penalties to unintended tokens. To reuse in such cases, a retraining step is required using the same behavioral delta procedure, but with the new model‚Äôs tokenizer and context pipeline.

üìå Recommendation:
- Prefer training BearMuzzle on the most common or stable tokenizer spec within your target deployment ecosystem.
- Maintain tokenizer documentation and versioning alongside model checkpoints to ensure reproducibility.

This approach supports seamless reuse of BearMuzzle across model variants that share a common token matrix, enabling efficient steering without retraining in many practical deployments.
### üßë‚Äçüíª Training on Consumer Hardware (e.g., Mac Mini M4)

While high-end GPUs accelerate data generation and training, compact 4-bit sidekick models can be trained on modern consumer machines with careful constraints.

Example: **Mac Mini M4 (2024), 16GB RAM**

| Factor                    | Value                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Model Size               | ~100M params, 4-bit (~50MB)                     |
| Training Hardware        | Mac Mini M4, 16GB unified memory, CPU+Metal GPU |
| Estimated Throughput     | ~2‚Äì5 samples/sec (tiny models only)             |
| Epoch Time               | 35‚Äì87 hours (1 epoch), 70‚Äì350 for full training |
| Training Duration        | 3‚Äì14 days continuous (for 2‚Äì4 epochs)           |
| Feasibility              | ‚úÖ Reasonable for a single-user, long-running job |
| Practicality             | ‚úÖ Yes, with patience and memory-aware batching  |

Tips:
- Keep batch sizes small (e.g., 4‚Äì8 samples)
- Use gradient accumulation to simulate larger batches
- Preprocess delta vectors in advance to reduce token load
- Checkpoint frequently to allow for restarts

This enables solo developers to build viable BearMuzzle models on consumer hardware.

### üìå Additional Implications

- **No llama.cpp Modifications Required**:  
  BearMuzzle interacts with existing APIs such as logit biasing or forced token sequences, requiring no patching of llama.cpp internals.

- **Decoupled Development**:  
  Because the penalty vectors are trained externally, BearMuzzle models can evolve independently from the LLM they steer‚Äîprovided the tokenization schema is shared.

- **Cross-Model Applicability**:
BearMuzzle sidekick models can be trained on drastically smaller or highly quantized versions of a given LLM and later applied to larger or more accurate models of the same architecture. As long as the token vocabulary and inference APIs remain consistent, this approach allows for low-cost, scalable training with generalization across model tiers and future generations.

- **Immediate Integration**:  
  Penalty overlays can be swapped in or out mid-inference without reinitializing or recompiling the base model.

- **Stackable Steering**:  
  This logit-layer mechanism can operate alongside activation-based controllers, supporting hybrid modulation pipelines.

## üß≠ Phase Two Development Prospects

The following ideas expand BearMuzzle‚Äôs capabilities by leveraging existing infrastructure‚Äînamely, the logit manipulation hook, external sidekick model, and runtime integration through llama.cpp‚Äôs token loop. None of these require internal modification to the main model.

### üîÑ Real-Time Modulation Enhancements

- **Drift Detection**  
  Detect deviation from intended tone, domain, or persona and dynamically suppress off-topic or irrelevant token groups.

- **Context-Aware Ending Bias**  
  Steer generation toward punctuation or semantic closure when nearing a logical wrap-up phase.

- **Soft Reminder Phrase Injection**  
  Insert a predetermined phrase mid-sequence without blocking or introducing delay, and mark it for post-removal. Useful for safety, disclaimers, or reframing prompts.

- **Stochasticity Damping in Sensitive Contexts**  
  Identify emotionally charged or safety-critical zones and reduce output entropy through logit scaling.

- **Topic Boundary Detection**  
  Recognize when a topic shift occurs and softly bias toward transitional phrases (e.g., ‚ÄúNext, let‚Äôs...‚Äù or ‚ÄúTo summarize‚Ä¶‚Äù).

### üß† Structure and Style Steering

- **Token Cage Completion**  
  Gradually increase penalty outside a targeted phrase to encourage convergence without forcing it explicitly.

- **Rolling Redundancy Avoidance**  
  Penalize tokens that would repeat recent bigrams or trigrams to prevent looping or verbose filler.

- **Mid-Stream Persona Shifting**  
  Change behavioral tone or domain vector mid-output based on context or external signal (e.g., from a UI toggle or control code).

- **Token-Time Awareness**  
  Adjust generation pacing or tone based on the real-time duration of inference, useful for responsive UIs.

- **Interrupt-Aware Smoothing**  
  When running in streamed environments, steer generation toward natural stopping points in anticipation of possible interruption.

### üîß Meta-Control Extensions

- **User-Controlled Persona Blending**  
  Dynamically compose behavior vectors (e.g., 40% safety + 30% helpfulness + 30% brevity) via UI or API input.

- **Adaptive Penalty Switching**  
  Replace or blend sidekick models or penalty overlays at runtime in response to detected dialogue phases or external events.
